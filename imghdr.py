"""
Mock implementation of the imghdr module.

This is a fallback for environments where the standard library imghdr module is not available.
The implementation is minimal and only supports the basic functionality needed by Telethon.

def what(file, h=None):
    """
    Mock function that returns the type of image contained in a file.
    
    This implementation always returns None, but Telethon will still work
    with this minimal implementation.
    
    Args:
        file: Path to a file or a file-like object
        h: Optional bytes header
        
    Returns:
        None (instead of the actual image type)
